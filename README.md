# proj6-Gcal
Snarf appointment data from a selection of a user's Google calendars 

## Inroduction
Allows users to use their Google calendars to see if they are busy or available over a user-selected date/time. Application uses  the [Google calendar API](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/) and [daterange selector](http://www.daterangepicker.com/)

## Run/Install
Fork and clone repo. Navigate to source directory and run `make run` on the CLI.

NOTE: Running with bugs currently due to issues I can not figure out with the calendar API, specifically in finding free times. Will be updated for final iteration, but for now the code base for available times is just an attempt.
